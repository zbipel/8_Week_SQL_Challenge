## About the 8 Week SQL Challenge

The [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://www.8weeksqlchallenge.com/) is an engaging challenge that helps you develop SQL skills by solving a variety of data-related problems. Each task is a different "case study" that requires data analysis and writing SQL queries to answer specific questions.

## Repository Structure

In this repository, you'll find a "Solutions" folder. Inside the "Solutions" folder, you'll discover individual SQL script files for each case study.

## How to Use This Repository

If you're a participant in the 8 Week SQL Challenge and are looking for inspiration or solutions to a specific case study, you can browse the relevant folder and explore my solutions. I also encourage discussion and sharing of your own solutions and ideas for improving the code.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and I wish you success in completing the SQL challenges!
